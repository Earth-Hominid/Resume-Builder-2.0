This project's purpose is to refactor React Class Components into Functional Components utilizing React Hooks.

## Description

In order to practice using React Hooks, I have refactored my original Resume Builder application (which was built using React Class Components) using React Hooks and functional components.

Switch statements were utilized to build a "stepping through process", which provides this one page application the feel of multiple pages.

[Live Demo](https://earth-hominid.github.io/Resume-Builder-2.0/) :point_left:

The original project, [Resume-Builder 1.0](https://github.com/Earth-Hominid/Resume-Builder-1.0), consisted of creating a web-application that empowers a user to create their own resume and automatically formats it for them.

This was an excellent project for learning about state in React.
